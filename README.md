# hello-world
First repository!

Hey folks,
Excited to learn about Python and collaborate with others in the process!
I know a bit of HTML/CSS, VBA, and MATLAB, and I'm excited to learn more!
I want to work toward a better understanding of data science, because I 
already know the science part (M.A. in Psychology), and want to get a more
firm understanding of how to work with the data part!
